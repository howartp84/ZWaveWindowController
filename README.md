Introducing the ZWave Window Controller plugin

For those wanting to jump straight in, the latest download link is always at the bottom of this post.

Current Features

Coming soon

Planned for later

Installation notes
This plugin creates a number of Actions under "Z-Wave Window Controller actions" to raise/lower blinds.

Those who have seen me around the forums will know I usually participate in the forums at least daily if not several times; however please be aware this is usually from my iPhone when I'm away from my desk. I will endeavour to support this plugin as quickly as possible, but (as with everyone) I have busy periods of the year when I'm simply not at my desk long enough to do all I'd like to, including fixing or updating plugin code, even if you see me actively responding to other threads.

Enjoy!

Peter
